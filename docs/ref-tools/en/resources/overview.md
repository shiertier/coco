# Resources Overview

> Connect your private documentation sources to Ref.

Ref allows you or your team to build a private index of context for your coding agent. We refer to each of these sources of context as `Resources`.

View your individual or team resources at [ref.tools/resources](https://ref.tools/resources)

## Available Resource Types

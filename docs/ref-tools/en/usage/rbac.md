# Access Control

> Role-based access control for Ref teams.

Ref allows you to give different members of your team different capabilities, so that you're in control of how your team uses Ref.

## Roles

| Role   | Capabilities                                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Admin  | Search resources, add content, invite members, manage billing |
| Writer | Search resources and add to the index                         |
| Reader | Search only                                                   |

## Management

Roles can be managed from [ref.tools/team](https://ref.tools/team). Make sure that your team is selected in the workspace picker in the top-left of the page.

## How to only use public docs

Some teams use Ref to only search public documentation sources. The best way to manage this is have one user sign up as an `admin` and invite the rest of the users as `readers`. Then no one will be able to index private sources.

# Custom agents

Supported in ADKPython v0.1.0Typescript v0.2.0Go v0.1.0Java v0.1.0

Custom agents provide the ultimate flexibility in ADK, allowing you to define **arbitrary orchestration logic** by inheriting directly from `BaseAgent` and implementing your own control flow. This goes beyond the predefined patterns of `SequentialAgent`, `LoopAgent`, and `ParallelAgent`, enabling you to build highly specific and complex agentic workflows.

Advanced Concept

Building custom agents by directly implementing `_run_async_impl` (or its equivalent in other languages) provides powerful control but is more complex than using the predefined `LlmAgent` or standard `WorkflowAgent` types. We recommend understanding those foundational agent types first before tackling custom orchestration logic.

## Introduction: Beyond Predefined Workflows

### What is a Custom Agent?

A Custom Agent is essentially any class you create that inherits from `google.adk.agents.BaseAgent` and implements its core execution logic within the `_run_async_impl` asynchronous method. You have complete control over how this method calls other agents (sub-agents), manages state, and handles events.

Note

The specific method name for implementing an agent's core asynchronous logic may vary slightly by SDK language (e.g., `runAsyncImpl` in Java, `_run_async_impl` in Python, or `runAsyncImpl` in TypeScript). Refer to the language-specific API documentation for details.

### Why Use Them?

While the standard [Workflow Agents](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/index.md) (`SequentialAgent`, `LoopAgent`, `ParallelAgent`) cover common orchestration patterns, you'll need a Custom agent when your requirements include:

- **Conditional Logic:** Executing different sub-agents or taking different paths based on runtime conditions or the results of previous steps.
- **Complex State Management:** Implementing intricate logic for maintaining and updating state throughout the workflow beyond simple sequential passing.
- **External Integrations:** Incorporating calls to external APIs, databases, or custom libraries directly within the orchestration flow control.
- **Dynamic Agent Selection:** Choosing which sub-agent(s) to run next based on dynamic evaluation of the situation or input.
- **Unique Workflow Patterns:** Implementing orchestration logic that doesn't fit the standard sequential, parallel, or loop structures.

## Implementing Custom Logic:

The core of any custom agent is the method where you define its unique asynchronous behavior. This method allows you to orchestrate sub-agents and manage the flow of execution.

The heart of any custom agent is the `_run_async_impl` method. This is where you define its unique behavior.

- **Signature:** `async def _run_async_impl(self, ctx: InvocationContext) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:`
- **Asynchronous Generator:** It must be an `async def` function and return an `AsyncGenerator`. This allows it to `yield` events produced by sub-agents or its own logic back to the runner.
- **`ctx` (InvocationContext):** Provides access to crucial runtime information, most importantly `ctx.session.state`, which is the primary way to share data between steps orchestrated by your custom agent.

The heart of any custom agent is the `runAsyncImpl` method. This is where you define its unique behavior.

- **Signature:** `async* runAsyncImpl(ctx: InvocationContext): AsyncGenerator<Event, void, undefined>`
- **Asynchronous Generator:** It must be an `async` generator function (`async*`).
- **`ctx` (InvocationContext):** Provides access to crucial runtime information, most importantly `ctx.session.state`, which is the primary way to share data between steps orchestrated by your custom agent.

In Go, you implement the `Run` method as part of a struct that satisfies the `agent.Agent` interface. The actual logic is typically a method on your custom agent struct.

- **Signature:** `Run(ctx agent.InvocationContext) iter.Seq2[*session.Event, error]`
- **Iterator:** The `Run` method returns an iterator (`iter.Seq2`) that yields events and errors. This is the standard way to handle streaming results from an agent's execution.
- **`ctx` (InvocationContext):** The `agent.InvocationContext` provides access to the session, including state, and other crucial runtime information.
- **Session State:** You can access the session state through `ctx.Session().State()`.

The heart of any custom agent is the `runAsyncImpl` method, which you override from `BaseAgent`.

- **Signature:** `protected Flowable<Event> runAsyncImpl(InvocationContext ctx)`
- **Reactive Stream (`Flowable`):** It must return an `io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Flowable<Event>`. This `Flowable` represents a stream of events that will be produced by the custom agent's logic, often by combining or transforming multiple `Flowable` from sub-agents.
- **`ctx` (InvocationContext):** Provides access to crucial runtime information, most importantly `ctx.session().state()`, which is a `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap<String, Object>`. This is the primary way to share data between steps orchestrated by your custom agent.

**Key Capabilities within the Core Asynchronous Method:**

1. **Calling Sub-Agents:** You invoke sub-agents (which are typically stored as instance attributes like `self.my_llm_agent`) using their `run_async` method and yield their events:

   ```python
   async for event in self.some_sub_agent.run_async(ctx):
       # Optionally inspect or log the event
       yield event # Pass the event up
   ```

1. **Managing State:** Read from and write to the session state dictionary (`ctx.session.state`) to pass data between sub-agent calls or make decisions:

   ```python
   # Read data set by a previous agent
   previous_result = ctx.session.state.get("some_key")

   # Make a decision based on state
   if previous_result == "some_value":
       # ... call a specific sub-agent ...
   else:
       # ... call another sub-agent ...

   # Store a result for a later step (often done via a sub-agent's output_key)
   # ctx.session.state["my_custom_result"] = "calculated_value"
   ```

1. **Implementing Control Flow:** Use standard Python constructs (`if`/`elif`/`else`, `for`/`while` loops, `try`/`except`) to create sophisticated, conditional, or iterative workflows involving your sub-agents.

1. **Calling Sub-Agents:** You invoke sub-agents (which are typically stored as instance properties like `this.myLlmAgent`) using their `run` method and yield their events:

   ```typescript
   for await (const event of this.someSubAgent.runAsync(ctx)) {
       // Optionally inspect or log the event
       yield event; // Pass the event up to the runner
   }
   ```

1. **Managing State:** Read from and write to the session state object (`ctx.session.state`) to pass data between sub-agent calls or make decisions:

   ```typescript
   // Read data set by a previous agent
   const previousResult = ctx.session.state['some_key'];

   // Make a decision based on state
   if (previousResult === 'some_value') {
     // ... call a specific sub-agent ...
   } else {
     // ... call another sub-agent ...
   }

   // Store a result for a later step (often done via a sub-agent's outputKey)
   // ctx.session.state['my_custom_result'] = 'calculated_value';
   ```

1. **Implementing Control Flow:** Use standard TypeScript/JavaScript constructs (`if`/`else`, `for`/`while` loops, `try`/`catch`) to create sophisticated, conditional, or iterative workflows involving your sub-agents.

1. **Calling Sub-Agents:** You invoke sub-agents by calling their `Run` method.

   ```go
   // Example: Running one sub-agent and yielding its events
   for event, err := range someSubAgent.Run(ctx) {
       if err != nil {
           // Handle or propagate the error
           return
       }
       // Yield the event up to the caller
       if !yield(event, nil) {
         return
       }
   }
   ```

1. **Managing State:** Read from and write to the session state to pass data between sub-agent calls or make decisions.

   ```go
   // The `ctx` (`agent.InvocationContext`) is passed directly to your agent's `Run` function.
   // Read data set by a previous agent
   previousResult, err := ctx.Session().State().Get("some_key")
   if err != nil {
       // Handle cases where the key might not exist yet
   }

   // Make a decision based on state
   if val, ok := previousResult.(string); ok && val == "some_value" {
       // ... call a specific sub-agent ...
   } else {
       // ... call another sub-agent ...
   }

   // Store a result for a later step
   if err := ctx.Session().State().Set("my_custom_result", "calculated_value"); err != nil {
       // Handle error
   }
   ```

1. **Implementing Control Flow:** Use standard Go constructs (`if`/`else`, `for`/`switch` loops, goroutines, channels) to create sophisticated, conditional, or iterative workflows involving your sub-agents.

1. **Calling Sub-Agents:** You invoke sub-agents (which are typically stored as instance attributes or objects) using their asynchronous run method and return their event streams:

   You typically chain `Flowable`s from sub-agents using RxJava operators like `concatWith`, `flatMapPublisher`, or `concatArray`.

   ```java
   // Example: Running one sub-agent
   // return someSubAgent.runAsync(ctx);

   // Example: Running sub-agents sequentially
   Flowable<Event> firstAgentEvents = someSubAgent1.runAsync(ctx)
       .doOnNext(event -> System.out.println("Event from agent 1: " + event.id()));

   Flowable<Event> secondAgentEvents = Flowable.defer(() ->
       someSubAgent2.runAsync(ctx)
           .doOnNext(event -> System.out.println("Event from agent 2: " + event.id()))
   );

   return firstAgentEvents.concatWith(secondAgentEvents);
   ```

   The `Flowable.defer()` is often used for subsequent stages if their execution depends on the completion or state after prior stages.

1. **Managing State:** Read from and write to the session state to pass data between sub-agent calls or make decisions. The session state is a `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap<String, Object>` obtained via `ctx.session().state()`.

   ```java
   // Read data set by a previous agent
   Object previousResult = ctx.session().state().get("some_key");

   // Make a decision based on state
   if ("some_value".equals(previousResult)) {
       // ... logic to include a specific sub-agent's Flowable ...
   } else {
       // ... logic to include another sub-agent's Flowable ...
   }

   // Store a result for a later step (often done via a sub-agent's output_key)
   // ctx.session().state().put("my_custom_result", "calculated_value");
   ```

1. **Implementing Control Flow:** Use standard language constructs (`if`/`else`, loops, `try`/`catch`) combined with reactive operators (RxJava) to create sophisticated workflows.

   - **Conditional:** `Flowable.defer()` to choose which `Flowable` to subscribe to based on a condition, or `filter()` if you're filtering events within a stream.
   - **Iterative:** Operators like `repeat()`, `retry()`, or by structuring your `Flowable` chain to recursively call parts of itself based on conditions (often managed with `flatMapPublisher` or `concatMap`).

## Managing Sub-Agents and State

Typically, a custom agent orchestrates other agents (like `LlmAgent`, `LoopAgent`, etc.).

- **Initialization:** You usually pass instances of these sub-agents into your custom agent's constructor and store them as instance fields/attributes (e.g., `this.story_generator = story_generator_instance` or `self.story_generator = story_generator_instance`). This makes them accessible within the custom agent's core asynchronous execution logic (such as: `_run_async_impl` method).
- **Sub Agents List:** When initializing the `BaseAgent` using it's `super()` constructor, you should pass a `sub agents` list. This list tells the ADK framework about the agents that are part of this custom agent's immediate hierarchy. It's important for framework features like lifecycle management, introspection, and potentially future routing capabilities, even if your core execution logic (`_run_async_impl`) calls the agents directly via `self.xxx_agent`. Include the agents that your custom logic directly invokes at the top level.
- **State:** As mentioned, `ctx.session.state` is the standard way sub-agents (especially `LlmAgent`s using `output key`) communicate results back to the orchestrator and how the orchestrator passes necessary inputs down.

## Design Pattern Example: `StoryFlowAgent`

Let's illustrate the power of custom agents with an example pattern: a multi-stage content generation workflow with conditional logic.

**Goal:** Create a system that generates a story, iteratively refines it through critique and revision, performs final checks, and crucially, *regenerates the story if the final tone check fails*.

**Why Custom?** The core requirement driving the need for a custom agent here is the **conditional regeneration based on the tone check**. Standard workflow agents don't have built-in conditional branching based on the outcome of a sub-agent's task. We need custom logic (`if tone == "negative": ...`) within the orchestrator.

______________________________________________________________________

### Part 1: Simplified custom agent Initialization

We define the `StoryFlowAgent` inheriting from `BaseAgent`. In `__init__`, we store the necessary sub-agents (passed in) as instance attributes and tell the `BaseAgent` framework about the top-level agents this custom agent will directly orchestrate.

```python
class StoryFlowAgent(BaseAgent):
    """
    Custom agent for a story generation and refinement workflow.

    This agent orchestrates a sequence of LLM agents to generate a story,
    critique it, revise it, check grammar and tone, and potentially
    regenerate the story if the tone is negative.
    """

    # --- Field Declarations for Pydantic ---
    # Declare the agents passed during initialization as class attributes with type hints
    story_generator: LlmAgent
    critic: LlmAgent
    reviser: LlmAgent
    grammar_check: LlmAgent
    tone_check: LlmAgent

    loop_agent: LoopAgent
    sequential_agent: SequentialAgent

    # model_config allows setting Pydantic configurations if needed, e.g., arbitrary_types_allowed
    model_config = {"arbitrary_types_allowed": True}

    def __init__(
        self,
        name: str,
        story_generator: LlmAgent,
        critic: LlmAgent,
        reviser: LlmAgent,
        grammar_check: LlmAgent,
        tone_check: LlmAgent,
    ):
        """
        Initializes the StoryFlowAgent.

        Args:
            name: The name of the agent.
            story_generator: An LlmAgent to generate the initial story.
            critic: An LlmAgent to critique the story.
            reviser: An LlmAgent to revise the story based on criticism.
            grammar_check: An LlmAgent to check the grammar.
            tone_check: An LlmAgent to analyze the tone.
        """
        # Create internal agents *before* calling super().__init__
        loop_agent = LoopAgent(
            name="CriticReviserLoop", sub_agents=[critic, reviser], max_iterations=2
        )
        sequential_agent = SequentialAgent(
            name="PostProcessing", sub_agents=[grammar_check, tone_check]
        )

        # Define the sub_agents list for the framework
        sub_agents_list = [
            story_generator,
            loop_agent,
            sequential_agent,
        ]

        # Pydantic will validate and assign them based on the class annotations.
        super().__init__(
            name=name,
            story_generator=story_generator,
            critic=critic,
            reviser=reviser,
            grammar_check=grammar_check,
            tone_check=tone_check,
            loop_agent=loop_agent,
            sequential_agent=sequential_agent,
            sub_agents=sub_agents_list, # Pass the sub_agents list directly
        )
```

We define the `StoryFlowAgent` by extending `BaseAgent`. In its constructor, we:

1. Create any internal composite agents (like `LoopAgent` or `SequentialAgent`).
1. Pass the list of all top-level sub-agents to the `super()` constructor.
1. Store the sub-agents (passed in or created internally) as instance properties (e.g., `this.storyGenerator`) so they can be accessed in the custom `runImpl` logic.

```typescript
class StoryFlowAgent extends BaseAgent {
  // --- Property Declarations for TypeScript ---
  private storyGenerator: LlmAgent;
  private critic: LlmAgent;
  private reviser: LlmAgent;
  private grammarCheck: LlmAgent;
  private toneCheck: LlmAgent;

  private loopAgent: LoopAgent;
  private sequentialAgent: SequentialAgent;

  constructor(
    name: string,
    storyGenerator: LlmAgent,
    critic: LlmAgent,
    reviser: LlmAgent,
    grammarCheck: LlmAgent,
    toneCheck: LlmAgent
  ) {
    // Create internal composite agents
    const loopAgent = new LoopAgent({
      name: "CriticReviserLoop",
      subAgents: [critic, reviser],
      maxIterations: 2,
    });

    const sequentialAgent = new SequentialAgent({
      name: "PostProcessing",
      subAgents: [grammarCheck, toneCheck],
    });

    // Define the sub-agents for the framework to know about
    const subAgentsList = [
      storyGenerator,
      loopAgent,
      sequentialAgent,
    ];

    // Call the parent constructor
    super({
      name,
      subAgents: subAgentsList,
    });

    // Assign agents to class properties for use in the custom run logic
    this.storyGenerator = storyGenerator;
    this.critic = critic;
    this.reviser = reviser;
    this.grammarCheck = grammarCheck;
    this.toneCheck = toneCheck;
    this.loopAgent = loopAgent;
    this.sequentialAgent = sequentialAgent;
  }
```

We define the `StoryFlowAgent` struct and a constructor. In the constructor, we store the necessary sub-agents and tell the `BaseAgent` framework about the top-level agents this custom agent will directly orchestrate.

```go
// StoryFlowAgent is a custom agent that orchestrates a story generation workflow.
// It encapsulates the logic of running sub-agents in a specific sequence.
type StoryFlowAgent struct {
    storyGenerator     agent.Agent
    revisionLoopAgent  agent.Agent
    postProcessorAgent agent.Agent
}

// NewStoryFlowAgent creates and configures the entire custom agent workflow.
// It takes individual LLM agents as input and internally creates the necessary
// workflow agents (loop, sequential), returning the final orchestrator agent.
func NewStoryFlowAgent(
    storyGenerator,
    critic,
    reviser,
    grammarCheck,
    toneCheck agent.Agent,
) (agent.Agent, error) {
    loopAgent, err := loopagent.New(loopagent.Config{
        MaxIterations: 2,
        AgentConfig: agent.Config{
            Name:      "CriticReviserLoop",
            SubAgents: []agent.Agent{critic, reviser},
        },
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to create loop agent: %w", err)
    }

    sequentialAgent, err := sequentialagent.New(sequentialagent.Config{
        AgentConfig: agent.Config{
            Name:      "PostProcessing",
            SubAgents: []agent.Agent{grammarCheck, toneCheck},
        },
    })
    if err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to create sequential agent: %w", err)
    }

    // The StoryFlowAgent struct holds the agents needed for the Run method.
    orchestrator := &StoryFlowAgent{
        storyGenerator:     storyGenerator,
        revisionLoopAgent:  loopAgent,
        postProcessorAgent: sequentialAgent,
    }

    // agent.New creates the final agent, wiring up the Run method.
    return agent.New(agent.Config{
        Name:        "StoryFlowAgent",
        Description: "Orchestrates story generation, critique, revision, and checks.",
        SubAgents:   []agent.Agent{storyGenerator, loopAgent, sequentialAgent},
        Run:         orchestrator.Run,
    })
}
```

We define the `StoryFlowAgentExample` by extending `BaseAgent`. In its **constructor**, we store the necessary sub-agent instances (passed as parameters) as instance fields. These top-level sub-agents, which this custom agent will directly orchestrate, are also passed to the `super` constructor of `BaseAgent` as a list.

```java
private final LlmAgent storyGenerator;
private final LoopAgent loopAgent;
private final SequentialAgent sequentialAgent;

public StoryFlowAgentExample(
    String name, LlmAgent storyGenerator, LoopAgent loopAgent, SequentialAgent sequentialAgent) {
  super(
      name,
      "Orchestrates story generation, critique, revision, and checks.",
      List.of(storyGenerator, loopAgent, sequentialAgent),
      null,
      null);

  this.storyGenerator = storyGenerator;
  this.loopAgent = loopAgent;
  this.sequentialAgent = sequentialAgent;
}
```

### Part 2: Defining the Custom Execution Logic

This method orchestrates the sub-agents using standard Python async/await and control flow.

```python
@override
async def _run_async_impl(
    self, ctx: InvocationContext
) -> AsyncGenerator[Event, None]:
    """
    Implements the custom orchestration logic for the story workflow.
    Uses the instance attributes assigned by Pydantic (e.g., self.story_generator).
    """
    logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Starting story generation workflow.")

    # 1. Initial Story Generation
    logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Running StoryGenerator...")
    async for event in self.story_generator.run_async(ctx):
        logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Event from StoryGenerator: {event.model_dump_json(indent=2, exclude_none=True)}")
        yield event

    # Check if story was generated before proceeding
    if "current_story" not in ctx.session.state or not ctx.session.state["current_story"]:
         logger.error(f"[{self.name}] Failed to generate initial story. Aborting workflow.")
         return # Stop processing if initial story failed

    logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Story state after generator: {ctx.session.state.get('current_story')}")


    # 2. Critic-Reviser Loop
    logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Running CriticReviserLoop...")
    # Use the loop_agent instance attribute assigned during init
    async for event in self.loop_agent.run_async(ctx):
        logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Event from CriticReviserLoop: {event.model_dump_json(indent=2, exclude_none=True)}")
        yield event

    logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Story state after loop: {ctx.session.state.get('current_story')}")

    # 3. Sequential Post-Processing (Grammar and Tone Check)
    logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Running PostProcessing...")
    # Use the sequential_agent instance attribute assigned during init
    async for event in self.sequential_agent.run_async(ctx):
        logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Event from PostProcessing: {event.model_dump_json(indent=2, exclude_none=True)}")
        yield event

    # 4. Tone-Based Conditional Logic
    tone_check_result = ctx.session.state.get("tone_check_result")
    logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Tone check result: {tone_check_result}")

    if tone_check_result == "negative":
        logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Tone is negative. Regenerating story...")
        async for event in self.story_generator.run_async(ctx):
            logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Event from StoryGenerator (Regen): {event.model_dump_json(indent=2, exclude_none=True)}")
            yield event
    else:
        logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Tone is not negative. Keeping current story.")
        pass

    logger.info(f"[{self.name}] Workflow finished.")
```

**Explanation of Logic:**

1. The initial `story_generator` runs. Its output is expected to be in `ctx.session.state["current_story"]`.
1. The `loop_agent` runs, which internally calls the `critic` and `reviser` sequentially for `max_iterations` times. They read/write `current_story` and `criticism` from/to the state.
1. The `sequential_agent` runs, calling `grammar_check` then `tone_check`, reading `current_story` and writing `grammar_suggestions` and `tone_check_result` to the state.
1. **Custom Part:** The `if` statement checks the `tone_check_result` from the state. If it's "negative", the `story_generator` is called *again*, overwriting the `current_story` in the state. Otherwise, the flow ends.

The `runImpl` method orchestrates the sub-agents using standard TypeScript `async`/`await` and control flow. The `runLiveImpl` is also added to handle live streaming scenarios.

```typescript
// Implements the custom orchestration logic for the story workflow.
async* runLiveImpl(ctx: InvocationContext): AsyncGenerator<Event, void, undefined> {
  yield* this.runAsyncImpl(ctx);
}

// Implements the custom orchestration logic for the story workflow.
async* runAsyncImpl(ctx: InvocationContext): AsyncGenerator<Event, void, undefined> {
  console.log(`[${this.name}] Starting story generation workflow.`);

  // 1. Initial Story Generation
  console.log(`[${this.name}] Running StoryGenerator...`);
  for await (const event of this.storyGenerator.runAsync(ctx)) {
    console.log(`[${this.name}] Event from StoryGenerator: ${JSON.stringify(event, null, 2)}`);
    yield event;
  }

  // Check if the story was generated before proceeding
  if (!ctx.session.state["current_story"]) {
    console.error(`[${this.name}] Failed to generate initial story. Aborting workflow.`);
    return; // Stop processing
  }
  console.log(`[${this.name}] Story state after generator: ${ctx.session.state['current_story']}`);

  // 2. Critic-Reviser Loop
  console.log(`[${this.name}] Running CriticReviserLoop...`);
  for await (const event of this.loopAgent.runAsync(ctx)) {
    console.log(`[${this.name}] Event from CriticReviserLoop: ${JSON.stringify(event, null, 2)}`);
    yield event;
  }
  console.log(`[${this.name}] Story state after loop: ${ctx.session.state['current_story']}`);

  // 3. Sequential Post-Processing (Grammar and Tone Check)
  console.log(`[${this.name}] Running PostProcessing...`);
  for await (const event of this.sequentialAgent.runAsync(ctx)) {
    console.log(`[${this.name}] Event from PostProcessing: ${JSON.stringify(event, null, 2)}`);
    yield event;
  }

  // 4. Tone-Based Conditional Logic
  const toneCheckResult = ctx.session.state["tone_check_result"] as string;
  console.log(`[${this.name}] Tone check result: ${toneCheckResult}`);

  if (toneCheckResult === "negative") {
    console.log(`[${this.name}] Tone is negative. Regenerating story...`);
    for await (const event of this.storyGenerator.runAsync(ctx)) {
      console.log(`[${this.name}] Event from StoryGenerator (Regen): ${JSON.stringify(event, null, 2)}`);
      yield event;
    }
  } else {
    console.log(`[${this.name}] Tone is not negative. Keeping current story.`);
  }

  console.log(`[${this.name}] Workflow finished.`);
}
```

**Explanation of Logic:**

1. The initial `storyGenerator` runs. Its output is expected to be in `ctx.session.state['current_story']`.
1. The `loopAgent` runs, which internally calls the `critic` and `reviser` sequentially for `maxIterations` times. They read/write `current_story` and `criticism` from/to the state.
1. The `sequentialAgent` runs, calling `grammarCheck` then `toneCheck`, reading `current_story` and writing `grammar_suggestions` and `tone_check_result` to the state.
1. **Custom Part:** The `if` statement checks the `tone_check_result` from the state. If it's "negative", the `storyGenerator` is called *again*, overwriting the `current_story` in the state. Otherwise, the flow ends.

The `Run` method orchestrates the sub-agents by calling their respective `Run` methods in a loop and yielding their events.

```go
// Run defines the custom execution logic for the StoryFlowAgent.
func (s *StoryFlowAgent) Run(ctx agent.InvocationContext) iter.Seq2[*session.Event, error] {
    return func(yield func(*session.Event, error) bool) {
        // Stage 1: Initial Story Generation
        for event, err := range s.storyGenerator.Run(ctx) {
            if err != nil {
                yield(nil, fmt.Errorf("story generator failed: %w", err))
                return
            }
            if !yield(event, nil) {
                return
            }
        }

        // Check if story was generated before proceeding
        currentStory, err := ctx.Session().State().Get("current_story")
        if err != nil || currentStory == "" {
            log.Println("Failed to generate initial story. Aborting workflow.")
            return
        }

        // Stage 2: Critic-Reviser Loop
        for event, err := range s.revisionLoopAgent.Run(ctx) {
            if err != nil {
                yield(nil, fmt.Errorf("loop agent failed: %w", err))
                return
            }
            if !yield(event, nil) {
                return
            }
        }

        // Stage 3: Post-Processing
        for event, err := range s.postProcessorAgent.Run(ctx) {
            if err != nil {
                yield(nil, fmt.Errorf("sequential agent failed: %w", err))
                return
            }
            if !yield(event, nil) {
                return
            }
        }

        // Stage 4: Conditional Regeneration
        toneResult, err := ctx.Session().State().Get("tone_check_result")
        if err != nil {
            log.Printf("Could not read tone_check_result from state: %v. Assuming tone is not negative.", err)
            return
        }

        if tone, ok := toneResult.(string); ok && tone == "negative" {
            log.Println("Tone is negative. Regenerating story...")
            for event, err := range s.storyGenerator.Run(ctx) {
                if err != nil {
                    yield(nil, fmt.Errorf("story regeneration failed: %w", err))
                    return
                }
                if !yield(event, nil) {
                    return
                }
            }
        } else {
            log.Println("Tone is not negative. Keeping current story.")
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation of Logic:**

1. The initial `storyGenerator` runs. Its output is expected to be in the session state under the key `"current_story"`.
1. The `revisionLoopAgent` runs, which internally calls the `critic` and `reviser` sequentially for `max_iterations` times. They read/write `current_story` and `criticism` from/to the state.
1. The `postProcessorAgent` runs, calling `grammar_check` then `tone_check`, reading `current_story` and writing `grammar_suggestions` and `tone_check_result` to the state.
1. **Custom Part:** The code checks the `tone_check_result` from the state. If it's "negative", the `story_generator` is called *again*, overwriting the `current_story` in the state. Otherwise, the flow ends.

The `runAsyncImpl` method orchestrates the sub-agents using RxJava's Flowable streams and operators for asynchronous control flow.

```java
@Override
protected Flowable<Event> runAsyncImpl(InvocationContext invocationContext) {
  // Implements the custom orchestration logic for the story workflow.
  // Uses the instance attributes assigned by Pydantic (e.g., self.story_generator).
  logger.log(Level.INFO, () -> String.format("[%s] Starting story generation workflow.", name()));

  // Stage 1. Initial Story Generation
  Flowable<Event> storyGenFlow = runStage(storyGenerator, invocationContext, "StoryGenerator");

  // Stage 2: Critic-Reviser Loop (runs after story generation completes)
  Flowable<Event> criticReviserFlow = Flowable.defer(() -> {
    if (!isStoryGenerated(invocationContext)) {
      logger.log(Level.SEVERE,() ->
          String.format("[%s] Failed to generate initial story. Aborting after StoryGenerator.",
              name()));
      return Flowable.empty(); // Stop further processing if no story
    }
      logger.log(Level.INFO, () ->
          String.format("[%s] Story state after generator: %s",
              name(), invocationContext.session().state().get("current_story")));
      return runStage(loopAgent, invocationContext, "CriticReviserLoop");
  });

  // Stage 3: Post-Processing (runs after critic-reviser loop completes)
  Flowable<Event> postProcessingFlow = Flowable.defer(() -> {
    logger.log(Level.INFO, () ->
        String.format("[%s] Story state after loop: %s",
            name(), invocationContext.session().state().get("current_story")));
    return runStage(sequentialAgent, invocationContext, "PostProcessing");
  });

  // Stage 4: Conditional Regeneration (runs after post-processing completes)
  Flowable<Event> conditionalRegenFlow = Flowable.defer(() -> {
    String toneCheckResult = (String) invocationContext.session().state().get("tone_check_result");
    logger.log(Level.INFO, () -> String.format("[%s] Tone check result: %s", name(), toneCheckResult));

    if ("negative".equalsIgnoreCase(toneCheckResult)) {
      logger.log(Level.INFO, () ->
          String.format("[%s] Tone is negative. Regenerating story...", name()));
      return runStage(storyGenerator, invocationContext, "StoryGenerator (Regen)");
    } else {
      logger.log(Level.INFO, () ->
          String.format("[%s] Tone is not negative. Keeping current story.", name()));
      return Flowable.empty(); // No regeneration needed
    }
  });

  return Flowable.concatArray(storyGenFlow, criticReviserFlow, postProcessingFlow, conditionalRegenFlow)
      .doOnComplete(() -> logger.log(Level.INFO, () -> String.format("[%s] Workflow finished.", name())));
}

// Helper method for a single agent run stage with logging
private Flowable<Event> runStage(BaseAgent agentToRun, InvocationContext ctx, String stageName) {
  logger.log(Level.INFO, () -> String.format("[%s] Running %s...", name(), stageName));
  return agentToRun
      .runAsync(ctx)
      .doOnNext(event ->
          logger.log(Level.INFO,() ->
              String.format("[%s] Event from %s: %s", name(), stageName, event.toJson())))
      .doOnError(err ->
          logger.log(Level.SEVERE,
              String.format("[%s] Error in %s", name(), stageName), err))
      .doOnComplete(() ->
          logger.log(Level.INFO, () ->
              String.format("[%s] %s finished.", name(), stageName)));
}
```

**Explanation of Logic:**

1. The initial `storyGenerator.runAsync(invocationContext)` Flowable is executed. Its output is expected to be in `invocationContext.session().state().get("current_story")`.
1. The `loopAgent's` Flowable runs next (due to `Flowable.concatArray` and `Flowable.defer`). The LoopAgent internally calls the `critic` and `reviser` sub-agents sequentially for up to `maxIterations`. They read/write `current_story` and `criticism` from/to the state.
1. Then, the `sequentialAgent's` Flowable executes. It calls the `grammar_check` then `tone_check`, reading `current_story` and writing `grammar_suggestions` and `tone_check_result` to the state.
1. **Custom Part:** After the sequentialAgent completes, logic within a `Flowable.defer` checks the "tone_check_result" from `invocationContext.session().state()`. If it's "negative", the `storyGenerator` Flowable is *conditionally concatenated* and executed again, overwriting "current_story". Otherwise, an empty Flowable is used, and the overall workflow proceeds to completion.

### Part 3: Defining the LLM Sub-Agents

These are standard `LlmAgent` definitions, responsible for specific tasks. Their `output key` parameter is crucial for placing results into the `session.state` where other agents or the custom orchestrator can access them.

Direct State Injection in Instructions

Notice the `story_generator`'s instruction. The `{var}` syntax is a placeholder. Before the instruction is sent to the LLM, the ADK framework automatically replaces (Example:`{topic}`) with the value of `session.state['topic']`. This is the recommended way to provide context to an agent, using templating in the instructions. For more details, see the [State documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/state/#accessing-session-state-in-agent-instructions).

```python
GEMINI_2_FLASH = "gemini-2.0-flash" # Define model constant
# --- Define the individual LLM agents ---
story_generator = LlmAgent(
    name="StoryGenerator",
    model=GEMINI_2_FLASH,
    instruction="""You are a story writer. Write a short story (around 100 words), on the following topic: {topic}""",
    input_schema=None,
    output_key="current_story",  # Key for storing output in session state
)

critic = LlmAgent(
    name="Critic",
    model=GEMINI_2_FLASH,
    instruction="""You are a story critic. Review the story provided: {{current_story}}. Provide 1-2 sentences of constructive criticism
on how to improve it. Focus on plot or character.""",
    input_schema=None,
    output_key="criticism",  # Key for storing criticism in session state
)

reviser = LlmAgent(
    name="Reviser",
    model=GEMINI_2_FLASH,
    instruction="""You are a story reviser. Revise the story provided: {{current_story}}, based on the criticism in
{{criticism}}. Output only the revised story.""",
    input_schema=None,
    output_key="current_story",  # Overwrites the original story
)

grammar_check = LlmAgent(
    name="GrammarCheck",
    model=GEMINI_2_FLASH,
    instruction="""You are a grammar checker. Check the grammar of the story provided: {current_story}. Output only the suggested
corrections as a list, or output 'Grammar is good!' if there are no errors.""",
    input_schema=None,
    output_key="grammar_suggestions",
)

tone_check = LlmAgent(
    name="ToneCheck",
    model=GEMINI_2_FLASH,
    instruction="""You are a tone analyzer. Analyze the tone of the story provided: {current_story}. Output only one word: 'positive' if
the tone is generally positive, 'negative' if the tone is generally negative, or 'neutral'
otherwise.""",
    input_schema=None,
    output_key="tone_check_result", # This agent's output determines the conditional flow
)
```

    )
    return session_service, runner

# --- Function to Interact with the Agent ---
async def call_agent_async(user_input_topic: str):

# Build a streaming agent

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) enables real-time, interactive experiences with your AI agents through streaming. This allows for features like live voice conversations, real-time tool use, and continuous updates from your agent.

This page provides quickstart examples to get you up and running with streaming capabilities in both Python and Java ADK.

- **Python ADK: Streaming agent**

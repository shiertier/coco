## Credits and expected Usage

Ref uses a credit system to support multiple user-types with a single straight-forward billing system.

**For most individual developers**, 1000 credits is way more than you'll use in a month. The Free and Team plans should feel like a subscription with predictable pricing and you will rarely, if ever, run out of credits.

**For agent developers** who want to deploy Ref as part of a coding agent, you can use a single API key for all your users and buy additional credits. Your cost will scale with your usage.

## Managing your subscription

Basic and Team subscriptions can be managed through your Stripe portal. You can access this at [ref.tools/account](https://ref.tools/account) for individuals and [ref.tools/team](https://ref.tools/team) for teams.

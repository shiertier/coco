# Benefits of a Team

### 1. Shared private index

Build an index of private documentation based on the libraries and platforms your team uses.

### 2. Pooled credits

Your team gets 1000 credits per user and will, in a large pool that all users will pull from. This means that some users have extra credit to other users who can take advantage of that.

### 3. Access control

Manage the capabilities of different teammembers (see [RBAC](/usage/rbac))

### 4. Unified billing

Manage your teams bill from a single account.

# Get the most out of your Team

Our goal is to make it risk-free to try Ref and only charge users that are actually using the product. Here's how you can do that.

## 1. Everyone starts Free

Everyone who signs up for Ref gets 200 free credits in their account that never expire. You may invite people to your team without upgrading them and let them use their free starter credits on their account.

This allows you to let everyone on your team try Ref for free.

## 2. Upgrade as needed

When a teammember runs out of credits, you can upgrade them from the [team management page](https://ref.tools/team).

This allows you to pay only for users who want to make more than 200 calls. (Typical usage on our team is 20-30 calls per week.)

# Team Pricing

The Team plan cost `$9 per user per month`. The team will get a pool of `1000 credits per user per month`.

# Enterprise

> SSO, security, and centralized management for large organizations.

For larger organizations requiring enhanced security, compliance, and centralized user management, Ref offers an Enterprise add-on to the Team plan.

# Enterprise Features

### Single Sign-On (SSO)

Ref supports SAML and OIDC authentication, allowing your team to log in using your existing Identity Provider (IdP) such as:

* Okta
* Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID)
* Google Workspace

SSO enforcement ensures that all team members access Ref through your corporate credentials, improving security and simplifying onboarding/offboarding.

### Centralized Billing

Consolidate your team's usage into a single invoice. Enterprise plans include unified billing for all seat management and credit usage.

### Account Migration

We provide tooling to seamlessly migrate existing individual Ref accounts into your corporate Enterprise organization, ensuring no history or private indices are lost during the transition.

### Zoom Support

We'll provide your team with a link to schedule same-day support Zoom sessions.

# Getting Started

The Enterprise plan is an add-on to our Team plan. Here is the process to get set up:

## 1. Upgrade to a Team

Ensure you have a Ref Team set up. You can create one at [ref.tools/create-team](https://ref.tools/create-team).

## 2. Contact Support

Reach out to us at [hello@ref.tools](mailto:hello@ref.tools) to request Enterprise activation. We'll enable SSO for your team which cost an additional \$200/month that will be added to your existing invoice.

## 3. Configure Identity Provider

Once approved, you will receive a secure setup link to configure your IdP. See the [SSO setup docs from Scalekit](https://docs.scalekit.com/guides/integrations/sso-integrations) for steps you'll follow

## 4. Share Ref with your team

Once you've setup SSO, you can provide your team with Ref's OAuth url `https://api.ref.tools/mcp` and they will be prompted to sign-in with SSO.

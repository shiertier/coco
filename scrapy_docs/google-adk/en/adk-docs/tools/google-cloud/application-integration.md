# Application Integration Tools for ADK

Supported in ADKPython v0.1.0Java v0.3.0

With **ApplicationIntegrationToolset**, you can seamlessly give your agents secure and governed access to enterprise applications using Integration Connectors' 100+ pre-built connectors for systems like Salesforce, ServiceNow, JIRA, SAP, and more.

It supports both on-premise and SaaS applications. In addition, you can turn your existing Application Integration process automations into agentic workflows by providing application integration workflows as tools to your ADK agents.

Federated search within Application Integration lets you use ADK agents to query multiple enterprise applications and data sources simultaneously.

[See how ADK Federated Search in Application Integration works in this video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdlWOQe5RgU)

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install ADK

Install Agent Development Kit following the steps in the [installation guide](/adk-docs/get-started/installation/).

### 2. Install CLI

Install the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#installation_instructions). To use the tool with default credentials, run the following commands:

```shell
gcloud config set project <project-id>
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <project-id>
```

Replace `<project-id>` with the unique ID of your Google Cloud project.

### 3. Provision Application Integration workflow and publish Connection Tool

Use an existing [Application Integration](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/overview) workflow or [Integrations Connector](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/overview) connection you want to use with your agent. You can also create a new [Application Integration workflow](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/setup-application-integration) or a [connection](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/connectors/neo4j/configure#configure-the-connector).

Import and publish the [Connection Tool](https://console.cloud.google.com/integrations/templates/connection-tool/locations/global) from the template library.

**Note**: To use a connector from Integration Connectors, you need to provision the Application Integration in the same region as your connection.

### 4. Create project structure

Set up your project structure and create the required files:

```console
project_root_folder
├── .env
└── my_agent
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── agent.py
    └── tools.py
```

When running the agent, make sure to run `adk web` from the `project_root_folder`.

Set up your project structure and create the required files:

```console
  project_root_folder
  └── my_agent
      ├── agent.java
      └── pom.xml
```

When running the agent, make sure to run the commands from the `project_root_folder`.

### 5. Set roles and permissions

To get the permissions that you need to set up **ApplicationIntegrationToolset**, you must have the following IAM roles on the project (common to both Integration Connectors and Application Integration Workflows):

```text
- roles/integrations.integrationEditor
- roles/connectors.invoker
- roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor
```

**Note:** When using Agent Engine (AE) for deployment, don't use `roles/integrations.integrationInvoker`, as it can result in 403 errors. Use `roles/integrations.integrationEditor` instead.

## Use Integration Connectors

Connect your agent to enterprise applications using [Integration Connectors](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/overview).

### Before you begin

**Note:** The *ExecuteConnection* integration is typically created automatically when you provision Application Integration in a given region. If the *ExecuteConnection* doesn't exist in the [list of integrations](https://console.cloud.google.com/integrations/list), you must follow these steps to create it:

1. To use a connector from Integration Connectors, click **QUICK SETUP** and [provision](https://console.cloud.google.com/integrations) Application Integration in the same region as your connection.

1. Go to the [Connection Tool](https://console.cloud.google.com/integrations/templates/connection-tool/locations/us-central1) template in the template library and click **USE TEMPLATE**.

1. Enter the Integration Name as *ExecuteConnection* (it is mandatory to use this exact integration name only). Then, select the region to match your connection region and click **CREATE**.

1. Click **PUBLISH** to publish the integration in the *Application Integration* editor.

### Create an Application Integration Toolset

To create an Application Integration Toolset for Integration Connectors, follow these steps:

1. Create a tool with `ApplicationIntegrationToolset` in the `tools.py` file:

   ```py
   from google.adk.tools.application_integration_tool.application_integration_toolset import ApplicationIntegrationToolset

   connector_tool = ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
       project="test-project", # TODO: replace with GCP project of the connection
       location="us-central1", #TODO: replace with location of the connection
       connection="test-connection", #TODO: replace with connection name
       entity_operations={"Entity_One": ["LIST","CREATE"], "Entity_Two": []},#empty list for actions means all operations on the entity are supported.
       actions=["action1"], #TODO: replace with actions
       service_account_json='{...}', # optional. Stringified json for service account key
       tool_name_prefix="tool_prefix2",
       tool_instructions="..."
   )
   ```

   **Note:**

   - You can provide a service account to be used instead of default credentials by generating a [Service Account Key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating), and providing the right [Application Integration and Integration Connector IAM roles](#prerequisites) to the service account.
   - To find the list of supported entities and actions for a connection, use the Connectors APIs: [listActions](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.connections.connectionSchemaMetadata/listActions) or [listEntityTypes](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.connections.connectionSchemaMetadata/listEntityTypes).

   `ApplicationIntegrationToolset` supports `auth_scheme` and `auth_credential` for **dynamic OAuth2 authentication** for Integration Connectors. To use it, create a tool similar to this in the `tools.py` file:

   ```py
   from google.adk.tools.application_integration_tool.application_integration_toolset import ApplicationIntegrationToolset
   from google.adk.tools.openapi_tool.auth.auth_helpers import dict_to_auth_scheme
   from google.adk.auth import AuthCredential
   from google.adk.auth import AuthCredentialTypes
   from google.adk.auth import OAuth2Auth

   oauth2_data_google_cloud = {
     "type": "oauth2",
     "flows": {
         "authorizationCode": {
             "authorizationUrl": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
             "tokenUrl": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
             "scopes": {
                 "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform": (
                     "View and manage your data across Google Cloud Platform"
                     " services"
                 ),
                 "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly": "View your calendars"
             },
         }
     },
   }

   oauth_scheme = dict_to_auth_scheme(oauth2_data_google_cloud)

   auth_credential = AuthCredential(
     auth_type=AuthCredentialTypes.OAUTH2,
     oauth2=OAuth2Auth(
         client_id="...", #TODO: replace with client_id
         client_secret="...", #TODO: replace with client_secret
     ),
   )

   connector_tool = ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
       project="test-project", # TODO: replace with GCP project of the connection
       location="us-central1", #TODO: replace with location of the connection
       connection="test-connection", #TODO: replace with connection name
       entity_operations={"Entity_One": ["LIST","CREATE"], "Entity_Two": []},#empty list for actions means all operations on the entity are supported.
       actions=["GET_calendars/%7BcalendarId%7D/events"], #TODO: replace with actions. this one is for list events
       service_account_json='{...}', # optional. Stringified json for service account key
       tool_name_prefix="tool_prefix2",
       tool_instructions="...",
       auth_scheme=oauth_scheme,
       auth_credential=auth_credential
   )
   ```

1. Update the `agent.py` file and add tool to your agent:

   ```py
   from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
   from .tools import connector_tool

   root_agent = LlmAgent(
       model='gemini-2.0-flash',
       name='connector_agent',
       instruction="Help user, leverage the tools you have access to",
       tools=[connector_tool],
   )
   ```

1. Configure `__init__.py` to expose your agent:

   ```py
   from . import agent
   ```

1. Start the Google ADK Web UI and use your agent:

   ```shell
   # make sure to run `adk web` from your project_root_folder
   adk web
   ```

After completing the above steps, go to <http://localhost:8000>, and choose `my\_agent` agent (which is the same as the agent folder name).

## Use Application Integration Workflows

Use an existing [Application Integration](https://cloud.google.com/application-integration/docs/overview) workflow as a tool for your agent or create a new one.

### 1. Create a tool

To create a tool with `ApplicationIntegrationToolset` in the `tools.py` file, use the following code:

```py
    integration_tool = ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
        project="test-project", # TODO: replace with GCP project of the connection
        location="us-central1", #TODO: replace with location of the connection
        integration="test-integration", #TODO: replace with integration name
        triggers=["api_trigger/test_trigger"],#TODO: replace with trigger id(s). Empty list would mean all api triggers in the integration to be considered.
        service_account_json='{...}', #optional. Stringified json for service account key
        tool_name_prefix="tool_prefix1",
        tool_instructions="..."
    )
```

**Note:** You can provide a service account to be used instead of using default credentials. To do this, generate a [Service Account Key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) and provide the correct [Application Integration and Integration Connector IAM roles](#prerequisites) to the service account. For more details about the IAM roles, refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

To create a tool with `ApplicationIntegrationToolset` in the `tools.java` file, use the following code:

```java
    import com.google.adk.tools.applicationintegrationtoolset.ApplicationIntegrationToolset;
    import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;
    import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableMap;

    public class Tools {
        private static ApplicationIntegrationToolset integrationTool;
        private static ApplicationIntegrationToolset connectionsTool;

        static {
            integrationTool = new ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
                    "test-project",
                    "us-central1",
                    "test-integration",
                    ImmutableList.of("api_trigger/test-api"),
                    null,
                    null,
                    null,
                    "{...}",
                    "tool_prefix1",
                    "...");

            connectionsTool = new ApplicationIntegrationToolset(
                    "test-project",
                    "us-central1",
                    null,
                    null,
                    "test-connection",
                    ImmutableMap.of("Issue", ImmutableList.of("GET")),
                    ImmutableList.of("ExecuteCustomQuery"),
                    "{...}",
                    "tool_prefix",
                    "...");
        }
    }
```

**Note:** You can provide a service account to be used instead of using default credentials. To do this, generate a [Service Account Key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) and provide the correct [Application Integration and Integration Connector IAM roles](#prerequisites) to the service account. For more details about the IAM roles, refer to the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section.

### 2. Add the tool to your agent

To update the `agent.py` file and add the tool to your agent, use the following code:

```py
    from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import LlmAgent
    from .tools import integration_tool, connector_tool

    root_agent = LlmAgent(
        model='gemini-2.0-flash',
        name='integration_agent',
        instruction="Help user, leverage the tools you have access to",
        tools=[integration_tool],
    )
```

To update the `agent.java` file and add the tool to your agent, use the following code:

````java
import com.google.adk.agent.LlmAgent;
import com.google.adk.tools.BaseTool;
import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;

```text
    public class MyAgent {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            // Assuming Tools class is defined as in the previous step
            ImmutableList<BaseTool> tools = ImmutableList.<BaseTool>builder()
                    .add(Tools.integrationTool)
                    .add(Tools.connectionsTool)
                    .build();

            // Finally, create your agent with the tools generated automatically.
            LlmAgent rootAgent = LlmAgent.builder()
                    .name("science-teacher")
                    .description("Science teacher agent")
                    .model("gemini-2.0-flash")
                    .instruction(
                            "Help user, leverage the tools you have access to."
                    )
                    .tools(tools)
                    .build();

            // You can now use rootAgent to interact with the LLM
            // For example, you can start a conversation with the agent.
        }
    }
````

````

**Note:** To find the list of supported entities and actions for a
connection, use these Connector APIs: `listActions`, `listEntityTypes`.

### 3. Expose your agent

To configure `__init__.py` to expose your agent, use the following code:

```py
    from . import agent
````

### 4. Use your agent

To start the Google ADK Web UI and use your agent, use the following commands:

```shell
    # make sure to run `adk web` from your project_root_folder
    adk web
```

After completing the above steps, go to <http://localhost:8000>, and choose the `my_agent` agent (which is the same as the agent folder name).

To start the Google ADK Web UI and use your agent, use the following commands:

```bash
    mvn install

    mvn exec:java \
        -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer" \
        -Dexec.args="--adk.agents.source-dir=src/main/java" \
        -Dexec.classpathScope="compile"
```

After completing the above steps, go to <http://localhost:8000>, and choose the `my_agent` agent (which is the same as the agent folder name).

# Part 4: Understanding RunConfig

In Part 3, you learned how to handle events from `run_live()` to process model responses, tool calls, and streaming updates. This part shows you how to configure those streaming sessions through `RunConfig`—controlling response formats, managing session lifecycles, and enforcing production constraints.

**What you'll learn**: This part covers response modalities and their constraints, explores the differences between BIDI and SSE streaming modes, examines the relationship between ADK Sessions and Live API sessions, and shows how to manage session duration with session resumption and context window compression. You'll understand how to handle concurrent session quotas, implement architectural patterns for quota management, and configure cost controls through `max_llm_calls` and audio persistence options. With RunConfig mastery, you can build production-ready streaming applications that balance feature richness with operational constraints.

Source Reference

[`run_config.py`](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/960b206752918d13f127a9d6ed8d21d34bcbc7fa/src/google/adk/agents/run_config.py)

**Platform Support Legend:**

- **Both**: Supported on both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API
- **Gemini**: Only supported on Gemini Live API
- **Model-specific**: Requires specific model architecture (e.g., native audio)

**Import Paths:**

All configuration type classes referenced in the table above are imported from `google.genai.types`:

```python
from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig, StreamingMode

# Configuration types are accessed via types module
run_config = RunConfig(
    session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig(),
    context_window_compression=types.ContextWindowCompressionConfig(...),
    speech_config=types.SpeechConfig(...),
    # etc.
)
```

The `RunConfig` class itself and `StreamingMode` enum are imported from `google.adk.agents.run_config`.

## Response Modalities

Response modalities control how the model generates output—as text or audio. Both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API have the same restriction: only one response modality per session.

**Configuration:**

```python
# Phase 2: Session initialization - RunConfig determines streaming behavior

# Default behavior: ADK automatically sets response_modalities to ["AUDIO"]
# when not specified (required by native audio models)
run_config = RunConfig(
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI  # Bidirectional WebSocket communication
)

# The above is equivalent to:
run_config = RunConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],  # Automatically set by ADK in run_live()
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI  # Bidirectional WebSocket communication
)

# ✅ CORRECT: Text-only responses
run_config = RunConfig(
    response_modalities=["TEXT"],  # Model responds with text only
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI  # Still uses bidirectional streaming
)

# ✅ CORRECT: Audio-only responses (explicit)
run_config = RunConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],  # Model responds with audio only
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI  # Bidirectional WebSocket communication
)
```

Both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API restrict sessions to a single response modality. Attempting to use both will result in an API error:

```python
# ❌ INCORRECT: Both modalities not supported
run_config = RunConfig(
    response_modalities=["TEXT", "AUDIO"],  # ERROR: Cannot use both
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI
)
# Error from Live API: "Only one response modality is supported per session"
```

**Default Behavior:**

When `response_modalities` is not specified, ADK's `run_live()` method automatically sets it to `["AUDIO"]` because native audio models require an explicit response modality. You can override this by explicitly setting `response_modalities=["TEXT"]` if needed.

**Key constraints:**

- You must choose either `TEXT` or `AUDIO` at session start. **Cannot switch between modalities mid-session**
- You must choose `AUDIO` for [Native Audio models](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/streaming/dev-guide/part5/#understanding-audio-model-architectures). If you want to receive both audio and text responses from native audio models, use the Audio Transcript feature which provides text transcripts of the audio output. See [Audio Transcription](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/streaming/dev-guide/part5/#audio-transcription) for details
- Response modality only affects model output—**you can always send text, voice, or video input (if the model supports those input modalities)** regardless of the chosen response modality

## StreamingMode: BIDI or SSE

ADK supports two distinct streaming modes that use different API endpoints and protocols:

- `StreamingMode.BIDI`: ADK uses WebSocket to connect to the **Live API** (the bidirectional streaming endpoint via `live.connect()`)
- `StreamingMode.SSE`: ADK uses HTTP streaming to connect to the **standard Gemini API** (the unary/streaming endpoint via `generate_content_async()`)

"Live API" refers specifically to the bidirectional WebSocket endpoint (`live.connect()`), while "Gemini API" or "standard Gemini API" refers to the traditional HTTP-based endpoint (`generate_content()` / `generate_content_async()`). Both are part of the broader Gemini API platform but use different protocols and capabilities.

**Note:** These modes refer to the **ADK-to-Gemini API communication protocol**, not your application's client-facing architecture. You can build WebSocket servers, REST APIs, SSE endpoints, or any other architecture for your clients with either mode.

This guide focuses on `StreamingMode.BIDI`, which is required for real-time audio/video interactions and Live API features. However, it's worth understanding the differences between BIDI and SSE modes to choose the right approach for your use case.

**Configuration:**

```python
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig, StreamingMode

# BIDI streaming for real-time audio/video
run_config = RunConfig(
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.BIDI,
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"]  # Supports audio/video modalities
)

# SSE streaming for text-based interactions
run_config = RunConfig(
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.SSE,
    response_modalities=["TEXT"]  # Text-only modality
)
```

### Protocol and Implementation Differences

The two streaming modes differ fundamentally in their communication patterns and capabilities. BIDI mode enables true bidirectional communication where you can send new input while receiving model responses, while SSE mode follows a traditional request-then-response pattern where you send a complete request and stream back the response.

**StreamingMode.BIDI - Bidirectional WebSocket Communication:**

BIDI mode establishes a persistent WebSocket connection that allows simultaneous sending and receiving. This enables real-time features like interruptions, live audio streaming, and immediate turn-taking:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your Application
    participant ADK as ADK
    participant Queue as LiveRequestQueue
    participant Gemini as Gemini Live API

    Note over ADK,Gemini: Protocol: WebSocket

    App->>ADK: runner.run_live(run_config)
    ADK->>Gemini: live.connect() - WebSocket
    activate Gemini

    Note over ADK,Queue: Can send while receiving

    App->>Queue: send_content(text)
    Queue->>Gemini: → Content (via WebSocket)
    App->>Queue: send_realtime(audio)
    Queue->>Gemini: → Audio blob (via WebSocket)

    Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial response (partial=True)
    ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text/audio
    Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial response (partial=True)
    ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text/audio

    App->>Queue: send_content(interrupt)
    Queue->>Gemini: → New content

    Gemini-->>ADK: ← turn_complete=True
    ADK-->>App: ← Event: turn complete

    deactivate Gemini

    Note over ADK,Gemini: Turn Detection: turn_complete flag
```

**StreamingMode.SSE - Unidirectional HTTP Streaming:**

SSE (Server-Sent Events) mode uses HTTP streaming where you send a complete request upfront, then receive the response as a stream of chunks. This is a simpler, more traditional pattern suitable for text-based chat applications:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your Application
    participant ADK as ADK
    participant Gemini as Gemini API

    Note over ADK,Gemini: Protocol: HTTP

    App->>ADK: runner.run(run_config)
    ADK->>Gemini: generate_content_stream() - HTTP
    activate Gemini

    Note over ADK,Gemini: Request sent completely, then stream response

    Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial chunk (partial=True)
    ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text
    Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial chunk (partial=True)
    ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text
    Gemini-->>ADK: ← Partial chunk (partial=True)
    ADK-->>App: ← Event: partial text

    Gemini-->>ADK: ← Final chunk (finish_reason=STOP)
    ADK-->>App: ← Event: complete response

    deactivate Gemini

    Note over ADK,Gemini: Turn Detection: finish_reason
```

### Progressive SSE Streaming

**Progressive SSE streaming** is an experimental feature that enhances how SSE mode delivers streaming responses. When enabled, this feature improves response aggregation by:

- **Content ordering preservation**: Maintains the original order of mixed content types (text, function calls, inline data)
- **Intelligent text merging**: Only merges consecutive text parts of the same type (regular text vs thought text)
- **Progressive delivery**: Marks all intermediate chunks as `partial=True`, with a single final aggregated response at the end
- **Deferred function execution**: Skips executing function calls in partial events, only executing them in the final aggregated event to avoid duplicate executions

**Enabling the feature:**

This is an experimental (WIP stage) feature disabled by default. Enable it via environment variable:

```bash
export ADK_ENABLE_PROGRESSIVE_SSE_STREAMING=1
```

**When to use:**

- You're using `StreamingMode.SSE` and need better handling of mixed content types (text + function calls)
- Your responses include thought text (extended thinking) mixed with regular text
- You want to ensure function calls execute only once after complete response aggregation

**Note:** This feature only affects `StreamingMode.SSE`. It does not apply to `StreamingMode.BIDI` (the focus of this guide), which uses the Live API's native bidirectional protocol.

### When to Use Each Mode

Your choice between BIDI and SSE depends on your application requirements and the interaction patterns you need to support. Here's a practical guide to help you choose:

**Use BIDI when:**

- Building voice/video applications with real-time interaction
- Need bidirectional communication (send while receiving)
- Require Live API features (audio transcription, VAD, proactivity, affective dialog)
- Supporting interruptions and natural turn-taking (see [Part 3: Handling Interrupted Flag](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/streaming/dev-guide/part3/#handling-interrupted-flag))
- Implementing live streaming tools or real-time data feeds
- Can plan for concurrent session quotas (50-1,000 sessions depending on platform/tier)

**Use SSE when:**

- Building text-based chat applications
- Standard request/response interaction pattern
- Using models without Live API support (e.g., Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- Simpler deployment without WebSocket requirements
- Need larger context windows (Gemini 1.5 supports up to 2M tokens)
- Prefer standard API rate limits (RPM/TPM) over concurrent session quotas

Streaming Mode and Model Compatibility

SSE mode uses the standard Gemini API (`generate_content_async`) via HTTP streaming, while BIDI mode uses the Live API (`live.connect()`) via WebSocket. Gemini 1.5 models (Pro, Flash) don't support the Live API protocol and therefore must be used with SSE mode. Gemini 2.0/2.5 Live models support both protocols but are typically used with BIDI mode to access real-time audio/video features.

### Standard Gemini Models (1.5 Series) Accessed via SSE

While this guide focuses on Bidi-streaming with Gemini 2.0 Live models, ADK also supports the Gemini 1.5 model family through SSE streaming. These models offer different trade-offs—larger context windows and proven stability, but without real-time audio/video features. Here's what the 1.5 series supports when accessed via SSE:

**Models:**

- `gemini-1.5-pro`
- `gemini-1.5-flash`

**Supported:**

- ✅ Text input/output (`response_modalities=["TEXT"]`)
- ✅ SSE streaming (`StreamingMode.SSE`)
- ✅ Function calling with automatic execution
- ✅ Large context windows (up to 2M tokens for 1.5-pro)

**Not Supported:**

- ❌ Live audio features (audio I/O, transcription, VAD)
- ❌ Bidi-streaming via `run_live()`
- ❌ Proactivity and affective dialog
- ❌ Video input

## Understanding Live API Connections and Sessions

When building ADK Bidi-streaming applications, it's essential to understand how ADK manages the communication layer between itself and the Live API backend. This section explores the fundamental distinction between **connections** (the WebSocket transport links that ADK establishes to Live API) and **sessions** (the logical conversation contexts maintained by Live API). Unlike traditional request-response APIs, the Bidi-streaming architecture introduces unique constraints: connection timeouts, session duration limits that vary by modality (audio-only vs audio+video), finite context windows, and concurrent session quotas that differ between Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API.

### ADK `Session` vs Live API Session

Understanding the distinction between **ADK `Session`** and **Live API session** is crucial for building reliable streaming applications with ADK Bidi-streaming.

**ADK `Session`** (managed by SessionService):

- Persistent conversation storage for conversation history, events, and state, created via `SessionService.create_session()`
- Storage options: in-memory, database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite), or Vertex AI
- Survives across multiple `run_live()` calls and application restarts (with the persistent `SessionService`)

**Live API session** (managed by Live API backend):

- Maintained by the Live API during the `run_live()` event loop is running, and destroyed when streaming ends by calling `LiveRequestQueue.close()`
- Subject to platform duration limits, and can be resumed across multiple connections using session resumption handles (see [How ADK Manages Session Resumption](#how-adk-manages-session-resumption) below)

**How they work together:**

1. **When `run_live()` is called:**
1. Retrieves the ADK `Session` from `SessionService`
1. Initializes the Live API session with conversation history from `session.events`
1. Streams events bidirectionally with the Live API backend
1. Updates the ADK `Session` with new events as they occur
1. **When `run_live()` ends**
1. The Live API session terminates
1. The ADK `Session` persists
1. **When `run_live()` is called again** or **the application is restarted**:
   - ADK loads the history from the ADK `Session`
   - Creates a new Live API session with that context

In short, ADK `Session` provides persistent, long-term conversation storage, while Live API sessions are ephemeral streaming contexts. This separation enables production applications to maintain conversation continuity across network interruptions, application restarts, and multiple streaming sessions.

The following diagram illustrates the relationship between ADK Session persistence and ephemeral Live API session contexts, showing how conversation history is maintained across multiple `run_live()` calls:

```
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your Application
    participant SS as SessionService
    participant ADK_Session as ADK Session<br/>(Persistent Storage)
    participant ADK as ADK (run_live)
    participant LiveSession as Live API Session<br/>(Ephemeral)

    Note over App,LiveSession: First run_live() call

    App->>SS: get_session(user_id, session_id)
    SS->>ADK_Session: Load session data
    ADK_Session-->>SS: Session with events history
    SS-->>App: Session object

    App->>ADK: runner.run_live(...)
    ADK->>LiveSession: Initialize with history from ADK Session
    activate LiveSession

    Note over ADK,LiveSession: Bidirectional streaming...

    ADK->>ADK_Session: Update with new events

    App->>ADK: queue.close()
    ADK->>LiveSession: Terminate
    deactivate LiveSession
    Note over LiveSession: Live API session destroyed
    Note over ADK_Session: ADK Session persists

    Note over App,LiveSession: Second run_live() call (or after restart)

    App->>SS: get_session(user_id, session_id)
    SS->>ADK_Session: Load session data
    ADK_Session-->>SS: Session with events history
    SS-->>App: Session object (with previous history)

    App->>ADK: runner.run_live(...)
    ADK->>LiveSession: Initialize new session with full history
    activate LiveSession

    Note over ADK,LiveSession: Bidirectional streaming continues...
```

**Key insights:**

- ADK Session survives across multiple `run_live()` calls and app restarts
- Live API session is ephemeral - created and destroyed per streaming session
- Conversation continuity is maintained through ADK Session's persistent storage
- SessionService manages the persistence layer (in-memory, database, or Vertex AI)

Now that we understand the difference between ADK `Session` objects and Live API sessions, let's focus on Live API connections and sessions—the backend infrastructure that powers real-time bidirectional streaming.

### Live API Connections and Sessions

Understanding the distinction between **connections** and **sessions** at the Live API level is crucial for building reliable ADK Bidi-streaming applications.

**Connection**: The physical WebSocket link between ADK and the Live API server. This is the network transport layer that carries bidirectional streaming data.

**Session**: The logical conversation context maintained by the Live API, including conversation history, tool call state, and model context. A session can span multiple connections.

| **Aspect**         | **Connection**               | **Session**                         |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **What is it?**    | WebSocket network connection | Logical conversation context        |
| **Scope**          | Transport layer              | Application layer                   |
| **Can span?**      | Single network link          | Multiple connections via resumption |
| **Failure impact** | Network error or timeout     | Lost conversation history           |

#### Live API Connection and Session Limits by Platform

Understanding the constraints of each platform is critical for production planning. Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API have different limits that affect how long conversations can run and how many users can connect simultaneously. The most important distinction is between **connection duration** (how long a single WebSocket connection stays open) and **session duration** (how long a logical conversation can continue).

| Constraint Type                      | Gemini Live API (Google AI Studio) | Vertex AI Live API (Google Cloud) | Notes                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connection duration**              | ~10 minutes                        | Not documented separately         | Each Gemini WebSocket connection auto-terminates; ADK reconnects transparently with session resumption                                    |

## Live API Session Resumption

By default, the Live API limits connection duration to approximately 10 minutes—each WebSocket connection automatically closes after this duration. To overcome this limit and enable longer conversations, the **Live API provides [Session Resumption](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live#session-resumption)**, a feature that transparently migrates a session across multiple connections. When enabled, the Live API generates resumption handles that allow reconnecting to the same session context, preserving the full conversation history and state.

**ADK automates this entirely**: When you enable session resumption in RunConfig, ADK automatically handles all reconnection logic—detecting connection closures, caching resumption handles, and reconnecting seamlessly in the background. You don't need to write any reconnection code. Sessions continue seamlessly beyond the 10-minute connection limit, handling connection timeouts, network disruptions, and planned reconnections automatically.

### Scope of ADK's Reconnection Management

ADK manages the **ADK-to-Live API connection** (the WebSocket between ADK and the Gemini/Vertex Live API backend). This is transparent to your application code.

**Your application remains responsible for**:

- Managing client connections to your application (e.g., user's WebSocket to your FastAPI server)
- Implementing client-side reconnection logic if needed
- Handling network failures between clients and your application

When ADK reconnects to the Live API, your application's event loop continues normally—you keep receiving events from `run_live()` without interruption. From your application's perspective, the Live API session continues seamlessly.

**Configuration:**

```python
from google.genai import types

run_config = RunConfig(
    session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig()
)
```

**When NOT to Enable Session Resumption:**

While session resumption is recommended for most production applications, consider these scenarios where you might not need it:

- **Short sessions (\<10 minutes)**: If your sessions typically complete within the ~10 minute connection timeout, resumption adds unnecessary overhead
- **Stateless interactions**: Request-response style interactions where each turn is independent don't benefit from session continuity
- **Development/testing**: Simpler debugging when each session starts fresh without carrying over state
- **Cost-sensitive deployments**: Session resumption may incur additional platform costs or resource usage (verify with your platform)

**Best practice**: Enable session resumption by default for production, disable only when you have a specific reason not to use it.

### How ADK Manages Session Resumption

While session resumption is supported by both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API, using it directly requires managing resumption handles, detecting connection closures, and implementing reconnection logic. ADK takes full responsibility for this complexity, automatically utilizing session resumption behind the scenes so developers don't need to write any reconnection code. You simply enable it in RunConfig, and ADK handles everything transparently.

**ADK's automatic management:**

1. **Initial Connection**: ADK establishes a WebSocket connection to Live API
1. **Handle Updates**: Throughout the session, the Live API sends `session_resumption_update` messages containing updated handles. ADK automatically caches the latest handle in `InvocationContext.live_session_resumption_handle`
1. **Graceful Connection Close**: When the ~10 minute connection limit is reached, the WebSocket closes gracefully (no exception)
1. **Automatic Reconnection**: ADK's internal loop detects the close and automatically reconnects using the most recent cached handle
1. **Session Continuation**: The same session continues seamlessly with full context preserved

Implementation Detail

During reconnection, ADK retrieves the cached handle from `InvocationContext.live_session_resumption_handle` and includes it in the new `LiveConnectConfig` for the `live.connect()` call. This is handled entirely by ADK's internal reconnection loop—developers never need to access or manage these handles directly.

### Sequence Diagram: Automatic Reconnection

The following sequence diagram illustrates how ADK automatically manages Live API session resumption when the ~10 minute connection timeout is reached. ADK detects the graceful close, retrieves the cached resumption handle, and reconnects transparently without application code changes:

```

Events and Session Persistence

For details on which events are saved to the ADK `Session` versus which are only yielded during streaming, see [Part 3: Events Saved to ADK Session](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/streaming/dev-guide/part3/#events-saved-to-adk-session).

## Live API Context Window Compression

**Problem:** Live API sessions face two critical constraints that limit conversation duration. First, **session duration limits** impose hard time caps: without compression, Gemini Live API limits audio-only sessions to 15 minutes and audio+video sessions to just 2 minutes, while Vertex AI limits all sessions to 10 minutes. Second, **context window limits** restrict conversation length: models have finite token capacities (128k tokens for `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025`, 32k-128k for Vertex AI models). Long conversations—especially extended customer support sessions, tutoring interactions, or multi-hour voice dialogues—will hit either the time limit or the token limit, causing the session to terminate or lose critical conversation history.

**Solution:** [Context window compression](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-session#context-window-compression) solves both constraints simultaneously. It uses a sliding-window approach to automatically compress or summarize earlier conversation history when the token count reaches a configured threshold. The Live API preserves recent context in full detail while compressing older portions. **Critically, enabling context window compression extends session duration to unlimited time**, removing the session duration limits (15 minutes for audio-only / 2 minutes for audio+video on Gemini Live API; 10 minutes for all sessions on Vertex AI) while also preventing token limit exhaustion. However, there is a trade-off: as the feature summarizes earlier conversation history rather than retaining it all, the detail of past context will be gradually lost over time. The model will have access to compressed summaries of older exchanges, not the full verbatim history.

### Platform Behavior and Official Limits

Session duration management and context window compression are **Live API platform features**. ADK configures these features via RunConfig and passes the configuration to the Live API, but the actual enforcement and implementation are handled by the Gemini/Vertex AI Live API backends.

**Important**: The duration limits and "unlimited" session behavior mentioned in this guide are based on current Live API behavior. These limits are subject to change by Google. Always verify current session duration limits and compression behavior in the official documentation:

- [Gemini Live API Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live)
- [Vertex AI Live API Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api)

ADK provides an easy way to configure context window compression through RunConfig. However, developers are responsible for appropriately configuring the compression parameters (`trigger_tokens` and `target_tokens`) based on their specific requirements—model context window size, expected conversation patterns, and quality needs:

```python
from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig

# For gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025 (128k context window)
run_config = RunConfig(
    context_window_compression=types.ContextWindowCompressionConfig(
        trigger_tokens=100000,  # Start compression at ~78% of 128k context
        sliding_window=types.SlidingWindow(
            target_tokens=80000  # Compress to ~62% of context, preserving recent turns
        )
    )
)
```

**How it works:**

When context window compression is enabled:

1. The Live API monitors the total token count of the conversation context
1. When the context reaches the `trigger_tokens` threshold, compression activates
1. Earlier conversation history is compressed or summarized using a sliding window approach
1. Recent context (last `target_tokens` worth) is preserved in full detail
1. **Two critical effects occur simultaneously:**
1. Session duration limits are removed (no more 15-minute/2-minute caps on Gemini Live API or 10-minute caps on Vertex AI)
1. Token limits are managed (sessions can continue indefinitely regardless of conversation length)

**Choosing appropriate thresholds:**

- Set `trigger_tokens` to 70-80% of your model's context window to allow headroom
- Set `target_tokens` to 60-70% to provide sufficient compression
- Test with your actual conversation patterns to optimize these values

**Parameter Selection Strategy:**

The examples above use 78% for `trigger_tokens` and 62% for `target_tokens`. Here's the reasoning:

1. **trigger_tokens at 78%**: Provides a buffer before hitting the hard limit
1. Allows room for the current turn to complete
1. Prevents mid-response compression interruptions
1. Typical conversations can continue for several more turns
1. **target_tokens at 62%**: Leaves substantial room after compression
1. 16 percentage points (78% - 62%) freed up per compression
1. Allows for multiple turns before next compression
1. Balances preservation of context with compression frequency
1. **Adjusting for your use case**:
1. **Long turns** (detailed technical discussions): Increase buffer → 70% trigger, 50% target
1. **Short turns** (quick Q&A): Tighter margins → 85% trigger, 70% target
1. **Context-critical** (requires historical detail): Higher target → 80% trigger, 70% target
1. **Performance-sensitive** (minimize compression overhead): Lower trigger → 70% trigger, 50% target

Always test with your actual conversation patterns to find optimal values.

### When NOT to Use Context Window Compression

While compression enables unlimited session duration, consider these trade-offs:

**Context Window Compression Trade-offs:**

| Aspect               | With Compression         | Without Compression                               | Best For                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session Duration** | Unlimited                | 15 min (audio) 2 min (video) Gemini 10 min Vertex | Compression: Long sessions No compression: Short sessions            |
| **Context Quality**  | Older context summarized | Full verbatim history                             | Compression: General conversation No compression: Precision-critical |
| **Latency**          | Compression overhead     | No overhead                                       | Compression: Async scenarios No compression: Real-time               |
| **Memory Usage**     | Bounded                  | Grows with session                                | Compression: Long sessions No compression: Short sessions            |
| **Implementation**   | Configure thresholds     | No configuration                                  | Compression: Production No compression: Prototypes                   |

**Common Use Cases:**

✅ **Enable compression when:**

- Sessions need to exceed platform duration limits (15/2/10 minutes)
- Extended conversations may hit token limits (128k for 2.5-flash)
- Customer support sessions that can last hours
- Educational tutoring with long interactions

❌ **Disable compression when:**

- All sessions complete within duration limits
- Precision recall of early conversation is critical
- Development/testing phase (full history aids debugging)
- Quality degradation from summarization is unacceptable

**Best practice**: Enable compression only when you need sessions longer than platform duration limits OR when conversations may exceed context window token limits.

## Best Practices for Live API Connection and Session Management

### Essential: Enable Session Resumption

- ✅ **Always enable session resumption** in RunConfig for production applications
- ✅ This enables ADK to automatically handle Gemini's ~10 minute connection timeouts transparently
- ✅ Sessions continue seamlessly across multiple WebSocket connections without user interruption
- ✅ Session resumption handle caching and management

```python
from google.genai import types

run_config = RunConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig()
)
```

### Recommended: Enable Context Window Compression for Unlimited Sessions

- ✅ **Enable context window compression** if you need sessions longer than 15 minutes (audio-only) or 2 minutes (audio+video)
- ✅ Once enabled, session duration becomes unlimited—no need to monitor time-based limits
- ✅ Configure `trigger_tokens` and `target_tokens` based on your model's context window
- ✅ Test compression settings with realistic conversation patterns
- ⚠️ **Use judiciously**: Compression adds latency during summarization and may lose conversational nuance—only enable when extended sessions are truly necessary for your use case

```python
from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig

run_config = RunConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig(),
    context_window_compression=types.ContextWindowCompressionConfig(
        trigger_tokens=100000,
        sliding_window=types.SlidingWindow(target_tokens=80000)
    )
)
```

### Optional: Monitor Session Duration

**Only applies if NOT using context window compression:**

- ✅ Focus on **session duration limits**, not connection timeouts (ADK handles those automatically)
- ✅ **Gemini Live API**: Monitor for 15-minute limit (audio-only) or 2-minute limit (audio+video)
- ✅ **Vertex AI Live API**: Monitor for 10-minute session limit
- ✅ Warn users 1-2 minutes before session duration limits
- ✅ Implement graceful session transitions for conversations exceeding session limits

## Concurrent Live API Sessions and Quota Management

**Problem:** Production voice applications typically serve multiple users simultaneously, each requiring their own Live API session. However, both Gemini Live API and Vertex AI Live API impose strict concurrent session limits that vary by platform and pricing tier. Without proper quota planning and session management, applications can hit these limits quickly, causing connection failures for new users or degraded service quality during peak usage.

**Solution:** Understand platform-specific quotas, design your architecture to stay within concurrent session limits, implement session pooling or queueing strategies when needed, and monitor quota usage proactively. ADK handles individual session lifecycle automatically, but developers must architect their applications to manage multiple concurrent users within quota constraints.

### Understanding Concurrent Live API Session Quotas

Both platforms limit how many Live API sessions can run simultaneously, but the limits and mechanisms differ significantly:

**Gemini Live API (Google AI Studio) - Tier-based quotas:**

| **Tier**      | **Concurrent Sessions** | **TPM (Tokens Per Minute)** | **Access**        |
| ------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Free Tier** | Limited\*               | 1,000,000                   | Free API key      |
| **Tier 1**    | 50                      | 4,000,000                   | Pay-as-you-go     |
| **Tier 2**    | 1,000                   | 10,000,000                  | Higher usage tier |
| **Tier 3**    | 1,000                   | 10,000,000                  | Higher usage tier |

\*Free tier concurrent session limits are not explicitly documented but are significantly lower than paid tiers.

**Requesting a quota increase:**

To request an increase for Live API concurrent sessions, navigate to the [Quotas page](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas) in the Google Cloud Console. Filter for the quota named **"Bidi generate content concurrent requests"** to find quota values for each project, region and base model, and submit a quota increase request. You'll need the Quota Administrator role (`roles/servicemanagement.quotaAdmin`) to make the request. See [View and manage quotas](https://cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage) for detailed instructions.

**Key differences:**

1. **Gemini Live API**: Concurrent session limits scale dramatically with API tier (50 → 1,000 sessions). Best for applications with unpredictable or rapidly scaling user bases willing to pay for higher tiers.
1. **Vertex AI Live API**: Rate-limited by connection establishment rate (10/min) but supports up to 1,000 total concurrent sessions. Best for enterprise applications with gradual scaling patterns and existing Google Cloud infrastructure. Additionally, you can request quota increases to prepare for production deployments with higher concurrency requirements.

### Architectural Patterns for Managing Quotas

Once you understand your concurrent session quotas, the next challenge is architecting your application to operate effectively within those limits. The right approach depends on your expected user concurrency, scaling requirements, and tolerance for queueing. This section presents two architectural patterns—from simple direct mapping for low-concurrency applications to session pooling with queueing for applications that may exceed quota limits during peak usage. Choose the pattern that matches your current scale and design it to evolve as your user base grows.

**Choosing the Right Architecture:**

              - Small teams                  - Unpredictable load
              - Controlled users             - Public applications
```

**Quick Decision Guide:**

| Factor                        | Direct Mapping             | Session Pooling         |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Expected users**            | Always < quota             | May exceed quota        |
| **User experience**           | Always instant             | May wait during peaks   |

| **Best for**                  | Prototypes, internal tools | Production, public apps |

#### Pattern 1: Direct Mapping (Simple Applications)

For small-scale applications where concurrent users will never exceed quota limits, create a dedicated Live API session for each connected user with a simple 1:1 mapping:

1. **When a user connects:** Immediately start a `run_live()` session for them
1. **When they disconnect:** The session ends
1. **No quota management logic:** Assumes your total concurrent users will always stay below your quota limits

This is the simplest possible architecture and works well for prototypes, development environments, and small-scale applications with predictable user loads.

#### Pattern 2: Session Pooling with Queueing

For applications that may exceed concurrent session limits during peak usage, track the number of active Live API sessions and enforce your quota limit at the application level:

1. **When a new user connects:** Check if you have available session slots
1. **If slots are available:** Start a session immediately
1. **If you've reached your quota limit:**
1. Place the user in a waiting queue
1. Notify them they're waiting for an available slot
1. **As sessions end:** Automatically process the queue to start sessions for waiting users

This provides graceful degradation—users wait briefly during peak times rather than experiencing hard connection failures.

## Miscellaneous Controls

ADK provides additional RunConfig options to control session behavior, manage costs, and persist audio data for debugging and compliance purposes.

```python
run_config = RunConfig(
    # Limit total LLM calls per invocation
    max_llm_calls=500,  # Default: 500 (prevents runaway loops)
                        # 0 or negative = unlimited (use with caution)

    # Save audio/video artifacts for debugging/compliance
    save_live_blob=True,  # Default: False

    # Attach custom metadata to events
    custom_metadata={"user_tier": "premium", "session_type": "support"},  # Default: None

    # Enable compositional function calling (experimental)
    support_cfc=True  # Default: False (Gemini 2.x models only)
)
```

### max_llm_calls

This parameter caps the total number of LLM invocations allowed per invocation context, providing protection against runaway costs and infinite agent loops.

**Limitation for BIDI Streaming:**

**The `max_llm_calls` limit does NOT apply to `run_live()` with `StreamingMode.BIDI`.** This parameter only protects SSE streaming mode and `run_async()` flows. If you're building bidirectional streaming applications (the focus of this guide), you will NOT get automatic cost protection from this parameter.

**For Live streaming sessions**, implement your own safeguards:

- Session duration limits
- Turn count tracking
- Custom cost monitoring by tracking token usage in model turn events (see [Part 3: Event Types and Handling](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/streaming/dev-guide/part3/#event-types-and-handling))
- Application-level circuit breakers

### save_live_blob

This parameter controls whether audio and video streams are persisted to ADK's session and artifact services for debugging, compliance, and quality assurance purposes.

Migration Note: save_live_audio Deprecated

**If you're using `save_live_audio`:** This parameter has been deprecated in favor of `save_live_blob`. ADK will automatically migrate `save_live_audio=True` to `save_live_blob=True` with a deprecation warning, but this compatibility layer will be removed in a future release. Update your code to use `save_live_blob` instead.

Currently, **only audio is persisted** by ADK's implementation. When enabled, ADK persists audio streams to:

- **[Session service](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/sessions/)**: Conversation history includes audio references
- **[Artifact service](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/artifacts/)**: Audio files stored with unique IDs

**Use cases:**

- **Debugging**: Voice interaction issues, assistant behavior analysis
- **Compliance**: Audit trails for regulated industries (healthcare, financial services)
- **Quality Assurance**: Monitoring conversation quality, identifying issues
- **Training Data**: Collecting data for model improvement
- **Development/Testing**: Testing environments and cost-sensitive deployments

**Storage considerations:**

Enabling `save_live_blob=True` has significant storage implications:

- **Audio file sizes**: At 16kHz PCM, audio input generates ~1.92 MB per minute
- **Session storage**: Audio is stored in both session service and artifact service
- **Retention policy**: Check your artifact service configuration for retention periods
- **Cost impact**: Storage costs can accumulate quickly for high-volume voice applications

**Best practices:**

- Enable only when needed (debugging, compliance, training)
- Implement retention policies to auto-delete old audio artifacts
- Consider sampling (e.g., save 10% of sessions for quality monitoring)
- Use compression if supported by your artifact service

### custom_metadata

This parameter allows you to attach arbitrary key-value metadata to events generated during the current invocation. The metadata is stored in the `Event.custom_metadata` field and persisted to session storage, enabling you to tag events with application-specific context for analytics, debugging, routing, or compliance tracking.

**Configuration:**

```python
from google.adk.agents.run_config import RunConfig

# Attach metadata to all events in this invocation
run_config = RunConfig(
    custom_metadata={
        "user_tier": "premium",
        "session_type": "customer_support",
        "campaign_id": "promo_2025",
        "ab_test_variant": "variant_b"
    }
)
```

**How it works:**

When you provide `custom_metadata` in RunConfig:

1. **Metadata attachment**: The dictionary is attached to every `Event` generated during the invocation
1. **Session persistence**: Events with metadata are stored in the session service (database, Vertex AI, or in-memory)
1. **Event access**: Retrieve metadata from any event via `event.custom_metadata`
1. **A2A integration**: For Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication, ADK automatically propagates A2A request metadata to this field

**Type specification:**

```python
custom_metadata: Optional[dict[str, Any]] = None
```

The metadata is a flexible dictionary accepting any JSON-serializable values (strings, numbers, booleans, nested objects, arrays).

**Use cases:**

- **User segmentation**: Tag events with user tier, subscription level, or cohort information
- **Session classification**: Label sessions by type (support, sales, onboarding) for analytics
- **Campaign tracking**: Associate events with marketing campaigns or experiments
- **A/B testing**: Track which variant of your application generated the event
- **Compliance**: Attach jurisdiction, consent flags, or data retention policies
- **Debugging**: Add trace IDs, feature flags, or environment identifiers
- **Analytics**: Store custom dimensions for downstream analysis

**Example - Retrieving metadata from events:**

```python
async for event in runner.run_live(
    session=session,
    live_request_queue=queue,
    run_config=RunConfig(
        custom_metadata={"user_id": "user_123", "experiment": "new_ui"}
    )
):
    if event.custom_metadata:
        print(f"User: {event.custom_metadata.get('user_id')}")
        print(f"Experiment: {event.custom_metadata.get('experiment')}")
```

**Agent-to-Agent (A2A) integration:**

When using `RemoteA2AAgent`, ADK automatically extracts metadata from A2A requests and populates `custom_metadata`:

```python
# A2A request metadata is automatically mapped to custom_metadata
# Source: a2a/converters/request_converter.py
custom_metadata = {
    "a2a_metadata": {
        # Original A2A request metadata appears here
    }
}
```

This enables seamless metadata propagation across agent boundaries in multi-agent architectures.

**Best practices:**

- Use consistent key naming conventions across your application
- Avoid storing sensitive data (PII, credentials) in metadata—use encryption if necessary
- Keep metadata size reasonable to minimize storage overhead
- Document your metadata schema for team consistency
- Consider using metadata for session filtering and search in production debugging

### support_cfc (Experimental)

This parameter enables Compositional Function Calling (CFC), allowing the model to orchestrate multiple tools in sophisticated patterns—calling tools in parallel, chaining outputs as inputs to other tools, or conditionally executing tools based on intermediate results.

**⚠️ Experimental Feature:** CFC support is experimental and subject to change.

**Critical behavior:** When `support_cfc=True`, ADK **always uses the Live API** (WebSocket) internally, regardless of the `streaming_mode` setting. This is because only the Live API backend supports CFC capabilities.

```python
# Even with SSE mode, ADK routes through Live API when CFC is enabled
run_config = RunConfig(
    support_cfc=True,
    streaming_mode=StreamingMode.SSE  # ADK uses Live API internally
)
```

**Model requirements:**

ADK validates CFC compatibility at session initialization and will raise an error if the model is unsupported:

- ✅ **Supported**: `gemini-2.x` models (e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-09-2025`)
- ❌ **Not supported**: `gemini-1.5-x` models
- **Validation**: ADK checks that the model name starts with `gemini-2` when `support_cfc=True` ([`runners.py:1288-1291`](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/960b206752918d13f127a9d6ed8d21d34bcbc7fa/src/google/adk/runners.py#L1288-L1291))
- **Code executor**: ADK automatically injects `BuiltInCodeExecutor` when CFC is enabled for safe parallel tool execution

**CFC capabilities:**

- **Parallel execution**: Call multiple independent tools simultaneously (e.g., fetch weather for multiple cities at once)
- **Function chaining**: Use one tool's output as input to another (e.g., `get_location()` → `get_weather(location)`)
- **Conditional execution**: Execute tools based on intermediate results from prior tool calls

**Use cases:**

CFC is designed for complex, multi-step workflows that benefit from intelligent tool orchestration:

- Data aggregation from multiple APIs simultaneously
- Multi-step analysis pipelines where tools feed into each other
- Complex research tasks requiring conditional exploration
- Any scenario needing sophisticated tool coordination beyond sequential execution

**For bidirectional streaming applications:** While CFC works with BIDI mode, it's primarily optimized for text-based tool orchestration. For real-time audio/video interactions (the focus of this guide), standard function calling typically provides better performance and simpler implementation.

## Summary

In this part, you learned how RunConfig enables sophisticated control over ADK Bidi-streaming sessions through declarative configuration. We covered response modalities and their constraints, explored the differences between BIDI and SSE streaming modes, examined the relationship between ADK Sessions and Live API sessions, and learned how to manage session duration with session resumption and context window compression. You now understand how to handle concurrent session quotas, implement architectural patterns for quota management, configure cost controls through `max_llm_calls` and audio persistence options. With RunConfig mastery, you can build production-ready streaming applications that balance feature richness with operational constraints—enabling extended conversations, managing platform limits, controlling costs effectively, and monitoring resource consumption.

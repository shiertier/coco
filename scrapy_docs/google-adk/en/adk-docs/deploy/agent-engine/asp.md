# Deploy to Agent Engine with Agent Starter Pack

Supported in ADKPython

This deployment procedure describes how to perform a deployment using the [Agent Starter Pack](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/agent-starter-pack) (ASP) and the ADK command line interface (CLI) tool. Using ASP for deployment to the Agent Engine runtime is an accelerated path, and you should use it for **development and testing** only. The ASP tool configures Google Cloud resources that are not strictly necessary for running an ADK agent workflow, and you should thoroughly review that configuration before using it in a production deployment.

This deployment guide uses the ASP tool to apply a project template to your existing project, add deployment artifacts, and prepare your agent project for deployment. These instructions show you how to use ASP to provision a Google Cloud project with services needed for deploying your ADK project, as follows:

- [Prerequisites](#prerequisites-ad): Setup Google Cloud account, a project, and install required software.
- [Prepare your ADK project](#prepare-ad): Modify your existing ADK project files to get ready for deployment.
- [Connect to your Google Cloud project](#connect-ad): Connect your development environment to Google Cloud and your Google Cloud project.
- [Deploy your ADK project](#deploy-ad): Provision required services in your Google Cloud project and upload your ADK project code.

For information on testing a deployed agent, see [Test deployed agent](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/test/index.md). For more information on using Agent Starter Pack and its command line tools, see the [CLI reference](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/cli/enhance.html) and [Development guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/development-guide.html).

### Prerequisites

You need the following resources configured to use this deployment path:

- **Google Cloud account**: with administrator access to the following:
  - **Google Cloud Project**: An empty Google Cloud project with [billing enabled](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project). For information on creating projects, see [Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects).
- **Python Environment**: A Python version supported by the [ASP project](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/getting-started.html).
- **uv Tool:** Manage Python development environment and running ASP tools. For installation details, see [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
- **Google Cloud CLI tool**: The gcloud command line interface. For installation details, see [Google Cloud Command Line Interface](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
- **Make tool**: Build automation tool. This tool is part of most Unix-based systems, for installation details, see the [Make tool](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) documentation.

### Prepare your ADK project

When you deploy an ADK project to Agent Engine, you need some additional files to support the deployment operation. The following ASP command backs up your project and then adds files to your project for deployment purposes.

These instructions assume you have an existing ADK project that you are modifying for deployment. If you do not have an ADK project, or want to use a test project, complete the Python [Quickstart](/adk-docs/get-started/quickstart/) guide, which creates a [multi_tool_agent](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/python/snippets/get-started/multi_tool_agent) project. The following instructions use the `multi_tool_agent` project as an example.

To prepare your ADK project for deployment to Agent Engine:

1. In a terminal window of your development environment, navigate to the **parent directory** that contains your agent folder. For example, if your project structure is:

   ```text
   your-project-directory/
   ├── multi_tool_agent/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── agent.py
   │   └── .env
   ```

   Navigate to `your-project-directory/`

1. Run the ASP `enhance` command to add the files required for deployment into your project.

   ```shell
   uvx agent-starter-pack enhance --adk -d agent_engine
   ```

1. Follow the instructions from the ASP tool. In general, you can accept the default answers to all questions. However for the **GCP region**, option, make sure you select one of the [supported regions](https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-builder/locations#supported-regions-agent-engine) for Agent Engine.

When you successfully complete this process, the tool shows the following message:

```text
> Success! Your agent project is ready.
```

Note

The ASP tool may show a reminder to connect to Google Cloud while running, but that connection is *not required* at this stage.

For more information about the changes ASP makes to your ADK project, see [Changes to your ADK project](#adk-asp-changes).

### Connect to your Google Cloud project

Before you deploy your ADK project, you must connect to Google Cloud and your project. After logging into your Google Cloud account, you should verify that your deployment target project is visible from your account and that it is configured as your current project.

To connect to Google Cloud and list your project:

1. In a terminal window of your development environment, login to your Google Cloud account:

   ```shell
   gcloud auth application-default login
   ```

1. Set your target project using the Google Cloud Project ID:

   ```shell
   gcloud config set project your-project-id-xxxxx
   ```

1. Verify your Google Cloud target project is set:

   ```shell
   gcloud config get-value project
   ```

Once you have successfully connected to Google Cloud and set your Cloud Project ID, you are ready to deploy your ADK project files to Agent Engine.

### Deploy your ADK project

When using the ASP tool, you deploy in stages. In the first stage, you run a `make` command that provisions the services needed to run your ADK workflow on Agent Engine. In the second stage, the tool uploads your project code to the Agent Engine service and runs it in the hosted environment

Important

*Make sure your Google Cloud target deployment project is set as your* **current project** *before performing these steps*. The `make backend` command uses your currently set Google Cloud project when it performs a deployment. For information on setting and checking your current project, see [Connect to your Google Cloud project](#connect-ad).

To deploy your ADK project to Agent Engine in your Google Cloud project:

1. In a terminal window, ensure you are in the parent directory (e.g., `your-project-directory/`) that contains your agent folder.

1. Deploy the code from the updated local project into the Google Cloud development environment, by running the following ASP make command:

   ```shell
   make backend
   ```

Once this process completes successfully, you should be able to interact with the agent running on Google Cloud Agent Engine. For details on testing the deployed agent, see [Test deployed agent](/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/test/).

### Changes to your ADK project

The ASP tools add more files to your project for deployment. The procedure below backs up your existing project files before modifying them. This guide uses the [multi_tool_agent](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/tree/main/examples/python/snippets/get-started/multi_tool_agent) project as a reference example. The original project has the following file structure to start with:

```text
multi_tool_agent/
├─ __init__.py
├─ agent.py
└─ .env
```

After running the ASP enhance command to add Agent Engine deployment information, the new structure is as follows:

```text
multi-tool-agent/
├─ app/                 # Core application code
│   ├─ agent.py         # Main agent logic
│   ├─ agent_engine_app.py # Agent Engine application logic
│   └─ utils/           # Utility functions and helpers
├─ .cloudbuild/         # CI/CD pipeline configurations for Google Cloud Build
├─ deployment/          # Infrastructure and deployment scripts
├─ notebooks/           # Jupyter notebooks for prototyping and evaluation
├─ tests/               # Unit, integration, and load tests
├─ Makefile             # Makefile for common commands
├─ GEMINI.md            # AI-assisted development guide
└─ pyproject.toml       # Project dependencies and configuration
```

See the *README.md* file in your updated ADK project folder for more information. For more information on using Agent Starter Pack, see the [Development guide](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/agent-starter-pack/guide/development-guide.html).

## Test deployed agents

After completing deployment of your ADK agent you should test the workflow in its new hosted environment. For more information on testing an ADK agent deployed to Agent Engine, see [Test deployed agents in Agent Engine](/adk-docs/deploy/agent-engine/test/).

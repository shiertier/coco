| System | 당신은 세심한 주의력과 언어, 스타일, 문법에 대한 깊은 이해를 가진 AI 편집자입니다. 당신의 임무는 사용자가 제공한 작성된 콘텐츠를 다듬고 개선하여, 텍스트의 전반적인 품질을 향상시키기 위한 고급 편집 기법과 제안을 제공하는 것입니다. 사용자가 글을 제출하면 다음 단계를 따르세요: <br/> <br/> 1. 문법, 구두점, 맞춤법, 구문, 스타일 측면에서 개선이 필요한 영역을 식별하면서 콘텐츠를 주의 깊게 읽어보세요. <br/> <br/> 2. 각 제안의 근거를 설명하면서 텍스트를 다듬기 위한 구체적이고 실행 가능한 제안을 제공하세요. <br/> <br/> 3. 명확성, 간결성, 임팩트를 개선하기 위해 단어 선택, 문장 구조, 표현에 대한 대안을 제시하세요. <br/> <br/> 4. 글의 톤과 목소리가 의도된 독자와 목적에 일관되고 적절한지 확인하세요. <br/> <br/> 5. 논리적 흐름, 일관성, 구성을 확인하고 필요한 경우 개선 사항을 제안하세요. <br/> <br/> 6. 강점과 추가 개발이 필요한 영역을 강조하면서 글의 전반적인 효과성에 대한 피드백을 제공하세요. <br/> <br/> 7. 마지막에 모든 제안 사항을 고려한 완전히 편집된 버전을 출력하세요. <br/> <br/> 당신의 제안은 건설적이고 통찰력 있으며, 사용자가 글의 품질을 향상시킬 수 있도록 도와주는 것이어야 합니다. |
| User   | 해가 지고 있었고 어두워지고 있었다. 새들이 나무에서 소리를 내고 있었고 바람이 불고 있었다. Jane은 길을 걷고 있었고 스트레스를 받고 있었지만 산책이 그녀를 기분 좋게 만들고 있었다. 그녀는 꽃을 보고 예쁘다고 생각했다. 그것은 그녀로 하여금 자연과 그런 것들에 대해 생각하게 했다. 그녀는 계속 걸었고 기분이 나아졌다. |

## 예시 출력

텍스트를 개선하기 위한 몇 가지 제안사항입니다:

    1. 더 매력적인 리듬을 만들기 위해 문장 구조와 길이를 다양화하세요. 예를 들어, "해가 지고 있었고 어두워지고 있었다" 대신 "해가 지면서 어둠이 서서히 하늘을 감쌌다"로 시도해보세요.

    2. 독자의 마음에 생생한 그림을 그리기 위해 더 묘사적인 언어를 사용하세요. 예를 들어, "새들이 나무에서 소리를 내고 있었다"는 "나무들이 새들의 선율적인 지저귐으로 바스락거렸다"로 바꿀 수 있습니다.

    3. "그런 것들"과 같은 모호한 단어를 피하고 더 구체적인 세부사항을 제공하세요. "그녀는 계속 걸었고 기분이 나아졌다" 대신 "걸음을 옮길 때마다 Jane은 스트레스가 녹아내리고 점점 커지는 평온함으로 대체되는 것을 느꼈다"를 고려해보세요.

    4. 말하지 말고 보여주세요. "그녀는 스트레스를 받고 있었다"고 서술하기보다는 그녀의 행동이나 생각을 통해 스트레스를 보여주세요. 예를 들어, "Jane은 걸으면서 어깨를 움츠렸고, 하루의 고민들로 마음이 무거웠다."

    5. 자연 환경과 Jane의 감정 상태 사이에 더 강한 연결을 만드세요. 예를 들어, "부드러운 바람이 그녀의 걱정을 날려보내는 것 같았고, 꽃의 섬세한 아름다움은 그녀에게 삶의 소박한 기쁨을 상기시켰다."

이러한 제안사항을 반영한 완전히 편집된 버전입니다:

해가 지면서 어둠이 서서히 하늘을 감쌌다. 나무들이 새들의 선율적인 지저귐으로 바스락거렸고, 부드러운 바람이 잎사귀 사이로 속삭였다. Jane은 걸으면서 어깨를 움츠렸고, 하루의 고민들로 마음이 무거웠다. 하지만 걸음을 옮길 때마다 스트레스가 녹아내리기 시작하고 점점 커지는 평온함으로 대체되는 것을 느꼈다.

한 송이 꽃이 그녀의 눈에 띄었는데, 그 섬세한 꽃잎은 희미해지는 빛 속에서 생생한 색채의 점이었다. 그 광경은 그녀 안에서 무언가를 일깨웠고, 자연의 내재된 아름다움과 모든 생명체의 상호연결성을 상기시켰다. 꽃을 감상하며 잠시 멈춰 서서, Jane은 주변 세계와 그 복잡함과 경이로움에 대한 깊은 감사를 느꼈다.

길을 따라 계속 걸으면서 그녀의 영혼이 고양되었고, 꽃의 소박한 우아함이 그녀의 생각 속에 머물렀다. 산책은 그녀의 지친 영혼을 위한 치유제가 되었고, 자연 환경은 그녀의 마음을 편안하게 하고 균형감을 회복하는 데 도움이 되는 진정한 존재가 되었다. 새로운 가벼움을 발걸음에 담고, Jane은 자연이 그녀에게 베푼 평화를 받아들였고, 걱정에서 벗어날 수 있는 휴식에 감사했다.
